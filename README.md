# DiscordBot
A bot that speaks, inacts like Deadpool.

# Making sure of these steps before running up
If you want to use OpenAI's API or some different API, create your own api key in the env file.
# Incase the bot is running, but is not replying to texts, It's likely that it requires permission from server as well
so create a role specifically for the bot and you are good to go.
